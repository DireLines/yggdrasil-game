basics of how the tree works
the tree spans the entire universe and is the giver of life (Yggdrasil from Norse mythology)
branches / roots are ethereal and thus can't be seen or felt by non-ethereal beings
leaves / fruit / flowers are material
fruit contain seeds
seeds can be planted and tended to in suitable conditions to sprout leaves
leaves link back to the ethereal plane by acting as a portal between wherever they are planted and the ethereal plane where the tree is
leaves are planted in various locations in each of the nine dimensions (the Nine Realms from Norse Mythology)
leaves are pieces taken from the nine dimensions, while fruit/flowers are entirely of the tree

the dimensions
Midgard - idyllic earth, most common
Alfheim - magical stuff, marshy, mists, mind bending spells, rare
Svartalfheim - caves, dwarves, robots, industrial shit, riches
Vanaheim - forest, ruins, mind bending spells, lore
Muspelheim - fuckin fire, angry demon soldiers
Niflheim - fuckin ice, dragons
Hel - monsters, gloom, ghosts, common
Jotunheim - icy mountains, giants, beasts, common
Asgard - holy imagery, gods, storms

details
Hel overlaps with Niflheim
Muspelheim is hard to access due to being blocked off by Asgard
Hel / Niflheim primarily accessible at the bottom of the tree
Asgard primarily accessible at the top of the tree
Jotunheim / Vanaheim primarily accessible at the middle of the tree

other stuff in the tree
cosmic dust / space debris floats in from the void, being generally strange and surreal
ethereal creatures inhabit the tree, for example
    Nidhoggr, a giant serpent who haunts the bottom of the tree
    Vedrfolnir, a hawk who haunts the top of the tree along with an unnamed eagle (who is far larger)
    Ratatoskr, a squirrel who is a faithful servant of the tree and carries messages between Nidhoggr and Vedrfolnir
    squirrels/birds/bees all have nests among the leaves of the tree
vines cling to the trunk, mistletoe nestles in the upper branches
    their leaves act a little like the tree's leaves, but with their own rules
